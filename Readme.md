# Mesh Topology Simulation with LoRaWAN

This project involves creating a simulation of a **mesh topology** that includes **LoRaWAN**, featuring a few nodes, a gateway, and a single server. The simulation is developed using **ns-3**, a discrete-event network simulator widely used for network research and development.

## Features

- Simulation of a mesh topology with LoRaWAN protocol.
- Integration of multiple nodes communicating through a gateway.
- Centralized server to manage and process data.
- Developed using ns-3 for accurate and detailed simulation results.

## Requirements

- ns-3 (Network Simulator 3)
- [Additional dependencies, if any]

## How to Run

1. Install ns-3 (refer to the [official documentation](https://www.nsnam.org/documentation/)).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the simulation using the provided scripts.

## Notes

This simulation is intended for educational and research purposes, demonstrating the potential of mesh topologies in LoRaWAN networks.
